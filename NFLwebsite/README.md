# NFL Project Website

This repository contains all the html, rmd, etc. files used to create a local website to display our work for CDC 2020. I am not exactly sure how to present the site appropriately, so I'm going to explain how I open the "website" with the steps I took (sorry if you're reading this and know how to do this already).

Download zip file ->
I used VS Code to open it ->
Open terminal for NFLWebsite ->
npm init ->
npm install browser-sync ->
npx browser-sync start -sw
